                    Why should the focus be on conventions and better practices (in this order)?

                    There is no doubt that human imagination has no limits. We can imagine, we can
                    abstract
                    at a high level pretty complex concepts and ideas, but, eventually, we are
                    limited to
                    what we can deploy, what we can write, all the details we can hold in our heads.

                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    If we reach that limitation with a project, development will become slower,
                    things
                    will become hard to manage, to understand, things will get out of hand.
                    In order to overcome, to some degree, this impediment, we should have good code
                    design,
                    a good architecture, we should make things seem more natural.

                    How to make things seem more natural?
                </p>
                <p>
                    By following some current, accepted, good software engineering practices and
                    conventions which are proven solutions to our human limitations.

                    What is a convention? (2 definitions from the dictionary)
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>"A way in which something is usually done."</li>
                    <li>"An agreement between states covering particular matters, especially one
                        less formal than a treaty."</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    From this definition : "A way in which something is usually done." , we realize
                    that
                    conventions will help us work together as a group on some activities because
                    they are
                    an agreement, understood by many, on how things are usually done.
                    They should be accepted as a base for carrying out some work, but they should
                    not be
                    enforced (the word "usually" by definition implies something flexible). The
                    conventions
                    will help us to some degree, to feel more comfortable with our code base, find
                    our
                    way fast when changes are required.

                    Preservation is in our nature as human beings. We are always seeking for new
                    ways
                    of making our lives simpler. We drive a car instead of walking, we prefer to
                    manage machinery instead
                    of managing and working with people. Because of this, we have always tried to
                    find new ways in which things "should" be done to have higher satisfaction and
                    preservation levels.

                    You noticed how things changed because of human nature? From "usually done" we
                    went to
                    "should be done". We found a link between conventions and development/evolution.
                    It is in our nature to feel comfortable about things and of course software is
                    no
                    exception.

                    Having established "A way in which something is usually done.", next we have to
                    adapt.
                    As developers, we constantly have to do that. Every day, we have new problems to
                    solve.
                    New problems which may make us uncomfortable when following blindly the way in
                    which
                    something is usually done.

                    We have been doing this since forever. Look how human languages have evolved,
                    how
                    many new concepts we have created that we take them for granted now, like money
                    or
                    the economy. We simply shared with one another the knowledge, we agreed
                    that it's improving right now our way of life and accepted it as a new
                    convention.
                    We all agreed for example, in the case of money, that bartering will not cut it
                    anymore,
                    it's too hard to work with, to keep track of the value of every good in order
                    arrange
                    a fair deal. We have agreed to use a single unit to describe value. We have
                    paved the
                    way for something simpler, more natural and scalable.

                <p class="article-sub-title">
                    Who defines the proper conventions that we, as developers, should follow?
                </p>
                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    We do, as a community, by sharing with others our ideas that we worked so hard
                    on and
                    that we tried and tested and we realized that they improve development, not just
                    by
                    the number of problems we can solve in a given amount of time but also the way
                    we feel
                    about our code.

                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    This does not imply that we should follow blindly every set of rules the
                    majority
                    decides. We should also strive to understand the current accepted ways of doing
                    things
                    and come up with new ideas if we see any flaws or find a way to make things seem
                    simpler,
                    more natural.

                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    Even if our new ideas, solutions are not accepted by the majority, part of them
                    can
                    still be helpful, not just for others who can build an improved version of our
                    solutions,
                    but for ourselves also, it is part of our evolution as software developers,
                    engineers
                    that give shape to our world.

                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    We should not focus on aligning 100% to some practices imposed by a majority, or
                    some
                    organization that tries to enforce them. We should strive to come up with better
                    practices and not force every solution to be implemented in the same way. We
                    should
                    strive to evolve and find better ways of solving problems. We should run away
                    from
                    organizations, groups that are not flexible, where teams stay aligned 100% with
                    the
                    organization. These kind of groups, organizations lack the feel of evolution,
                    and when
                    they do decide to follow new, better practices, the costs might be too high to
                    apply
                    the changes (in the video linked below, at the end after minute 60, you can see
                    an
                    example where a company, Knight Capital Group, lost more than 450 million when
                    they
                    decided to update legacy code, 8 years old code. Shortly after this error, they
                    agreed to be acquired by another company).

                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    We should work with and follow people who want to apply better practices even if
                    they miss some of the requirements of a problem. They are the kind of people
                    who feel natural with their work, confident and can fit more details in their
                    heads
                    about a problem or a solution.<br /><br />

                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    If a company is focused on following some practices strictly with less room for
                    flexibility, would you want to follow such an organization? Will that company be
                    able
                    to keep up with progress when its priority is to enforce some standards for
                    better
                    delivery frequency? Will that company last long on a market that is constantly
                    changing?
                    I would answer no to all these questions. I know that companies still try to
                    keep up
                    with progress, but sadly, many times is not because of their internal culture,
                    but because of our desire to evolve.

                    "Our standardized monthly scrum performance report shows your delivery rate is

                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    These types of reports generally deny the existence of technical debt,
                    rule out flexibility, they enforce the organization standards.

                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    I do agree that there must be deadlines, reasonable ones, but these kind of
                    performance reports that focus on delivery often do not take into consideration
                    if
                    the code is maintainable, robust and if the ability to change comes natural.
                    Many
                    problems we are trying to solve are different and often when diving in the
                    details,
                    more problems emerge, problems which you may not notice if you are forced by
                    some
                    organization's standards.
